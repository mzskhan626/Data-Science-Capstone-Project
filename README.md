# Data-Science-Capstone-Project

### This capstone project explores key domains of data science, focusing on acquiring, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing datasets to extract valuable insights. Leveraging Python and various industry-standard data science tools, the project applies advanced techniques to support data-driven decision-making.

## Key Contributions:
- Conducted comprehensive data cleaning and preparation to ensure high-quality data for analysis.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **Pandas** and **NumPy** to uncover patterns and trends.
- Developed statistical models with **Scikit-learn** to predict and classify data, improving accuracy in forecasting.
- Visualized data using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, enabling clear and effective presentation of insights.
- Executed data queries using **SQL** for data extraction and management from relational databases.
- Built interactive dashboards and reports with **Tableau**/**Power BI**, providing a user-friendly interface for non-technical stakeholders.
- Integrated findings into actionable recommendations, optimizing decision-making.

## Tools & Technologies:
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Scikit-learn**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Means Clustering (adjust based on actual use)
- **SQL**: Data extraction and manipulation
- **Tableau / Power BI**: Interactive data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Documentation and analysis
- **Excel**: Supplementary analysis and data validation
